# Adrian_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Summary:
My project is an expansion of assignments that we did this year with additional features. In the program you can modify/create a hash table and bst from movie titles and the year the movie was released. 

How to Run
You can use a GNU compiler with c++11 to run it. I created it a program called codeblocks but it should work on other IDE's aswell. 

Dependencies
None

System Requirements:
CU Virtual Machine
Windows 10 (Should work with any operating system if you have the virtual machine)
No additional system requirements

Group Members
Working alone

Contributors
None - but you could be one :)

Open Issues/Bugs
Delete never finds a movie that's already in the tree
When you insert a movie (eg. Hello World 2015) 2 times and then print out the inventory instead of the output being Hello World 2015, Hello World 2015. It should display Hello World 2015 - 2 Copies.
